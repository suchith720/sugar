A parish is under the pastoral care and clerical jurisdiction of a parish priest, who might be assisted by one or more curates, and who operates from a parish church.Historically, a parish often covered the same geographical area as a manor (its association with the parish church remaining paramount).By extension the term parish refers not only to the territorial unit but to the people of its community or congregation as well as to church property within it.In England this church property was technically in ownership of the parish priest ex-officio, vested in him on his institution to that parish.n the wider picture of ecclesiastical polity, a parish comprises a division of a diocese or see. Parishes within a diocese may be grouped into a deanery or vicariate forane (or simply vicariate), overseen by a dean or vicar forane, or in some cases by an archpriest.']\u001b[0m\n",
