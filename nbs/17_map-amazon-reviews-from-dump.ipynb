Their size is nothing but joke for what they cost us now. I told my wife to never buy any Hersheys again!  Other brands offer a much better deal, taste just as good or better & Im happy to see stores offering so many more brands today.<br /> These simply cost too much being such small portions today & now they discovered metal inside them?  You must be chitting me, is this to add more weight so we get even less chocolate? Hey it is sold by weight?..lol<br />  Oh well\\' most our family was done with the Hershey brand when most their candy was no longer made in USA anyway but now my kids/grand kids all say they will never put it in their mouths again.<br />  If I\\'m anywhere near them they wont ever taste it again, that\\'s a sure bet.<br /> Ill also toss every Hershey product in the trash on Halloween.<br /> Glad todays kids are growing up learning just how bad Hershey\\'s actually is & here we all thought the exact opposite back in the dark ages. The fact of it all is they are utter trash & care more about money for sure! Its just a low grade product they sell tons of today due to all its wonderful marketing. Well no they sell 1/4 ton with their bars shrinking so much.<br /> With all its metal & other trash fillers inside ain\\'t it just fabulous?<br /> If your buying it for family/freinds to eat I can only hope & pray it dont make your loved ones deathly ill?
